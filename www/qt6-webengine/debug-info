In final linking stage ulimit 4096 is tried to set, but it doesn't work for jails:
ulimit: bad limit: Operation not permitted
MAX_FILES=4096 in poudriere conf

Linking with debug symbols causes high memory pressure

ld: error: /usr/lib/crtn.o:(.debug_aranges+0x6): relocation R_X86_64_32 out of range: 4948421891 is not in [0, 4294967295]; consider recompiling with -fdebug-types-section to reduce size of debug sections

"-fdebug-types-section" seems to fix it but takes a loooong time
