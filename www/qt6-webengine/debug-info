If the debug build fails following workaround might be useful:

- Disable tmpfs in poudriere via USE_TMPFS=no

- Use additional swap space

- Linking with debug symbols causes high memory pressure:

ld: error: /usr/lib/crtn.o:(.debug_aranges+0x6): relocation R_X86_64_32 out of range: 4948421891 is not in [0, 4294967295]; consider recompiling with -fdebug-types-section to reduce size of debug sections

  Setting CFLAGS+=-fdebug-types-section and CXXFLAGS+=-fdebug-types-section
  might help here but linking still requires a very long time to complete.

- FreeBSD 12.1 has Clang 10 which seems too old to compile the debug build:
In file included from ../../../../../qtwebengine-everywhere-src-6.4.0/src/3rdparty/chromium/v8/src/deoptimizer/translation-array.h:8: ../../../../../qtwebengine-everywhere-src-6.4.0/src/3rdparty/chromium/v8/src/codegen/register.h:29:48: error: member reference base type 'RegListBase' is not a structure or union
   int num_different_regs = RegListBase{regs...}.Count();
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~
                              ../../../../../qtwebengine-everywhere-src-6.4.0/src/3rdparty/chromium/v8/src/codegen/register.h:29:7: warning: uninitialized variable in a constexpr function is a C++20 extension [-Wc++20-extensions]
                                int num_different_regs = RegListBase{regs...}.Count();
                                      ^
- In the final linking stage ulimit 4096 is tried to set, but it doesn't work for jails:

ulimit: bad limit: Operation not permitted

  Setting MAX_FILES=4096 in poudriere.conf should help.

- Setting symbol_level=1 in cmake/Functions.cmake might also help.


There was also an issue with the missing "convert_dict.stamp" but this seems
to resolved by a workaround in cmake/Functions.cmake:
